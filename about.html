        <h2>Where did Pat come up with such a genius idea?</h2>
        <p>He first started crafting these fine cookies in small batches in his mountain cottage north of Snoqualmie falls, and people couldn't help but smell it for miles! Pat has brought that tradition to his now world famous store in Pikes Place Market, for all to enjoy.</p>
        <p>We actually grind up real northwestern chinook and whatever else fishermen drag in from the sea each morning to make these delicious treats. The best part is, you can't even taste the fish! With such a chewy, satisfying texture, they have become a locally beloved pairing with a hot cup of Seattle's finest, and will help chase away those depressing rainy days.</p>
        <p>The best part is they're packed with protein and yummy Omega-3 fish oils. MMMMMmmmmm!</p>
