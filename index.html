        <h2>Why Pat? Why?!</h2>
        <p>Because We can, and we are on a mission to be the worlds first fish cookie company! "What the heck are they, and how can they taste so delicious?" you might ask...and we'll tell you!</p>
        <p>They're cookies made into inconspicuous swirls or the shape of a salmon for the children, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever. Tourists will go gaga for them, locals will begrudgingly fall in love with them, and Pat will make a ton of money.</p>
        <p>Our cookies are quite the confectionary catch! Give them one little bite, and you'll love 'em for life.</p>
